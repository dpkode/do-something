# Factors influencing local nuisance flooding

Nuisance flooding is a term used to describe increasingly frequent flooding
observed in coastal areas. In Norfolk (and Hampton Roads) Virginia, increased
flooding occurs not only because of factors causing sea-level rise, but also
because of land-subsidence. These long-term forces interact with local and/or
shorter time-scale processes to drive local sea-level: tides, winds (speed and
direction), hydrography/geography, (relative) rainfall, and, perhaps, barometric pressure. Can inadequate or deteriorating drainage/sewer infrastructure increase the likelihood of flooding?

The goal of this project is to predict the timing, magnitude, and duration of flooding in the Ghent/Hague area of Norfolk, VA.

End product:

- Dashboard of interactive plots of flooding timing (when), magnitude (how high; area covered), and duration (how long) and also plots of independent variables like: rainfall (current, recent past/ground saturation), wind speed and direction, and astronomical tide data.
- Statistical model-based predictions for:
    - One-day
    - One-week
